# capstone-app
This is the (second attempt on a) mobile application which will submitted as a part of my Capstone Project for my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering. This project has been made using react-native bootstrapped by expo-client.

## How to run
1. Clone/fork/pull or whatever. I get confused with these names
2. Run ```npm install``` to install node modules
2.5. Make sure expo is installed globally
3. Change API keys to the actual ones
4. ```npm start``` go brrr
